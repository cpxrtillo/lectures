/**
 * Project Euler Problem 1 is stated as follows:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
 * of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the
 * sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * This example illustrates the most straight-forward approach to solve this
 * problem.
